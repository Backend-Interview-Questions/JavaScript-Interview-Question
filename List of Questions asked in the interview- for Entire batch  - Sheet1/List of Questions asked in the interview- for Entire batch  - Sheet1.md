Wildcards
---------
Have the function Wildcards(str) read str which will contain two strings separated by a space. 
The first string will consist of the following sets of characters: +, *, $, and {N} which is optional. 
The plus (+) character represents a single alphabetic character, the ($) character represents a number between 1-9, 
and the asterisk (*) represents a sequence of the same character of length 3 unless it is followed by {N} which 
represents how many characters should appear in the sequence where N will be at least 1. Your goal is to determine 
if the second string exactly matches the pattern of the first string in the input.
For example: if str is "++*{5} jtggggg" then the second string in this case does match the pattern, 
so your program should return the string true. If the second string does not match the pattern
your program should return the string false.
Examples
Input: "+++++* abcdehhhhhh"
Output: false
Input: "$**+*{2} 9mmmrrrkbb"
Output: true

Csharp JSON Cleaning
--------------------
In the C# file, write a program to perform a GET request on the route https://coderbyte.com/api/challenges/json/json-cleaning 
and then clean the object according to the following rules: Remove all keys that have values of N/A, -, or empty strings. 
If one of these values appear in an array, remove that single item from the array. Then console log the modified object as a string.
Example Input
{"name":{"first":"Daniel","middle":"N/A","last":"Smith"},"age":45}
Example Output
{"name":{"first":"Daniel","last":"Smith"},"age":45}

O/P - '000011110001111'
3. Same input, check the difference between the characters, if difference is greater than 5, print '0', otherwise '1'
O/P - '1110'
4. same input, check the difference , if the difference is less than equal to 5, print smaller character, and if the difference is more than 5, like suppose difference is 8 for 'e' to 'm', count till 5 then again start from 'e' and count till 8 - 5 that is 3 and print the third character

Advantage Club has a unique way of celebrating. Suppose the last celebration was when the number of users was N and the next celebration will happen when the number of users grows to M, such that N and M have the same digits only in a different order. Ankit is a new joiner and he missed the last celebration, write a code to help Ankit find M, i.e. the number of users Advantage Club needs to reach for the next celebration. Example: Input: N = "524976" Output: M = "526479"Also, mention the Time Complexity of your code.

1) sort a string alphabetically.
2) check equal number of "x" and "o" in a string and return true if it is present otherwise return false.
3) run length encoding algorithm.
4) game challenge question
1. write a program to reverse a string in alphabetical order.
2. write a program to count the frequency of characters of a string and add the frequency beside the character and return a new string
3. Given a string with the charecter "x" & "o" (example: xoxoxxooxxx) return true if frequency of "x" is same as "o" else return false.
4. connect 4 game



1. Sort and count the elements if the they are match then return true if not match return false
2.Have the function GameChallenge(strArr) read the strArr parameter being passed which will represent a 6x7 Connect Four board. The rules of the game are: two players alternate turns and place a colored disc down into the grid from the top and the disc falls down the column until it hits the bottom or until it hits a piece beneath it. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. The input strArr will represent a Connect Four board and it will be structured in the following format: ["R/Y","(R,Y,x,x,x,x,x)","(...)","(...)",...)] where R represents the player using red discs, Y represents the player using yellow discs and x represents an empty space on the board. The first element of strArr will be either R or Y and it represents whose turn it is. Your program should determine, based on whose turn it is, whether a space exists that can give that player a win. If a space does exist your program should return the space in the following format: (RxC) where R=row and C=column. If no space exists, return the string none. The board will always be in a legal setup.
For example, if strArr is: ["R","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,Y,Y,Y)"] then your program should return (3x4).
Another example, if strArr is: ["Y","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,Y,Y,x,x,x)","(x,R,R,Y,Y,x,R)","(x,Y,R,R,R,Y,R)"] then your program should return (3x3).
Examples
Input: ["R","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,Y,Y,Y)"]
Output: (3x4)
Answer in JavaScript using this function:
function GameChallenge(strArr) {
// code goes here
return strArr;
}
// keep this function call here
console.log(GameChallenge(readline()));
2 easy questions on string ,1 medium level question on string ,1 hard question related to game challenge includes four board problem
Circular printer,the mex game,1 SQL question,and 1 que from mongodb take input and return the data
1.Returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order
Ex. coding
Output-cdgino
2.string parameter being passed and return the string true if there is an equal number of x and o otherwise return the string false in javascript. Ex "xxxoooxoxooo"
3. take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the run length encoding algorithm. this algorithm works by taking the ocvurence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with single chatacter.
4. Game challenge related with rows and columns
Total 4 coding question ask 1 easy 2 mediam and 1 hard type question 
Q-1 take parameters as str "wwwggooed" Return output 3w2g2o1e1d
Q-2 take parameters as str "xxoxoox" Return output if count of x equal to count of o then return true otherwise return false 
Q-3 hard type question pass matrix input and return 3*3 matrix 
Exact question are not recall 
I didn't get the test....
1. Sort and count the elements if the they are match then return true if not match return false
2.Have the function GameChallenge(strArr) read the strArr parameter being passed which will represent a 6x7 Connect Four board. The rules of the game are: two players alternate turns and place a colored disc down into the grid from the top and the disc falls down the column until it hits the bottom or until it hits a piece beneath it. The object of the game is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. The input strArr will represent a Connect Four board and it will be structured in the following format: ["R/Y","(R,Y,x,x,x,x,x)","(...)","(...)",...)] where R represents the player using red discs, Y represents the player using yellow discs and x represents an empty space on the board. The first element of strArr will be either R or Y and it represents whose turn it is. Your program should determine, based on whose turn it is, whether a space exists that can give that player a win. If a space does exist your program should return the space in the following format: (RxC) where R=row and C=column. If no space exists, return the string none. The board will always be in a legal setup.
For example, if strArr is: ["R","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,Y,Y,Y)"] then your program should return (3x4).
Another example, if strArr is: ["Y","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,Y,Y,x,x,x)","(x,R,R,Y,Y,x,R)","(x,Y,R,R,R,Y,R)"] then your program should return (3x3).
Examples
Input: ["R","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,x,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,x,x,x)","(x,x,x,R,Y,Y,Y)"]
Output: (3x4)
Answer in JavaScript using this function:
function GameChallenge(strArr) {
// code goes here
return strArr;
}
// keep this function call here
console.log(GameChallenge(readline()));
1.Returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order
Ex. coding
Output-cdgino
2.string parameter being passed and return the string true if there is an equal number of x and o otherwise return the string false in javascript. Ex "xxxoooxoxooo"
3. take the str parameter being passed and return a compressed version of the string using the run length encoding algorithm. this algorithm works by taking the ocvurence of each repeating character and outputting that number along with single chatacter.
4. Game challenge related with rows and columns
1. Sort and count the elements if the they are match then return true if not match return false

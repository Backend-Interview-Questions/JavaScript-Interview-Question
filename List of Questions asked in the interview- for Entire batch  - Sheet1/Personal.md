**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

### What are your salary expectations?
**For non-tech Background** I am a very quick learner , i have been able to adapt my skills in this four months duration, i have been able to take my skills to that level , where i can perform in your company from day one. i am pretty confident be a litle boastful .Everyone should say i was amongst the top 5% of my batch.

The current batch that i am graduating with at FunctionUp, lot of people have taken placements their average package have been 7-8 LPA [company LPA + 2 LPA ] .Most of them have been placed in this bracket .May being (I am ) one of the top performer. i would expect somthing a higher rank .

I really like whatever intraction i had with the people working in this company in the two or three rounds of interviews . So, hence I am keen on joining the company but i would really appreciate if you can consider [/match] my expectations

### if HR says that i have no budget as your expectation

I respect whatever your constrains are, I understand that .I would really wish that you match my expectation and i am waiting for offer letter.

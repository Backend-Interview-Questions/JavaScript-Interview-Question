When constructor invoked?

Ans. The constructor in a React component is called before the component is mounted. When you implement the constructor for a React component, you need to call super(props) method before any other statement. If you do not call super(props) method, this. props will be undefined in the constructor and can lead to bugs.


# What is multiple inheritance ,and how can you achieve ?

Ans. Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit features from more than one parent object or parent class. It is distinct from single inheritance, where an object or class may only inherit from one particular object or class.


# What is interface ?

Ans. Interfaces receive functions and values provided by Logic Hooks and share them with other Logic Hooks or pass them as props to Pure Components. Logic Hooks are similar to Container Components. Pure Components are similar to Presentational Components.


# How can you achieve multithreading?
Ans. Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

React Native is single-threaded in nature. In its rendering process, rather than have multiple processes occur at the same time (multithreading), other components have to wait when one component is being rendered.

"Qs. What are constraints in sql
Ans : SQL constraints are a set of rules implemented on tables in relational databases to dictate what data can be inserted, updated or deleted in its tables. This is done to ensure the accuracy and the reliability of information stored in the table.
Examples :
NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value
UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are different
PRIMARY KEY - A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE. Uniquely identifies each row in a table"
"CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    Age int
);"
"Qs : What is Joins in SQL ?
Ans : The SQL Joins clause is used to combine records from two or more tables in a database. A JOIN is a means for combining fields from two tables by using values common to each."
"There are different types of joins available in SQL −
INNER JOIN − returns rows when there is a match in both tables.
LEFT JOIN − returns all rows from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table.
RIGHT JOIN − returns all rows from the right table, even if there are no matches in the left table.
FULL JOIN − returns rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
SELF JOIN − is used to join a table to itself as if the table were two tables, temporarily renaming at least one table in the SQL statement.
CARTESIAN JOIN − returns the Cartesian product of the sets of records from the two or more joined tables."
"Qs :  What is the key difference between DBMS and RDBMS
Ans : Database Management System (DBMS) is a software that is used to define, create and maintain a database and provides controlled access to the data."

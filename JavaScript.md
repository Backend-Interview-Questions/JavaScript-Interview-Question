### JavaScript

1. ### What is javascript? How does it work?
**Ans. JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language. Javascript is used by programmers across the world to create dynamic and interactive web content like applications and browsers.
     JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. A program such as C++ or Java needs to be compiled before it is run. The source code is passed through a program called a compiler, which translates it into bytecode that the machine understands and can execute. In contrast, JavaScript has no compilation step. Instead, an interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it.**
